### Introduction:
This is an example of the creational design pattern called "Prototype" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example allows you to generate a 100% exact copy of a Zombie with all the items that it has as copies of the items that the original Zombie has. 

You can your logic to use this, implementing not only for the zombie, also with the items.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Prototype/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Prototype/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
